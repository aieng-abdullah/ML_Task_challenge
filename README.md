# 🚀 120-Day Career Acceleration Challenge  
### From Python Foundations to Job-Ready ML Engineer

This repository documents a **120-day execution-focused learning sprint** aimed at becoming job-ready in **Python, Machine Learning, and Applied Data Science**.

This is not a casual learning repo.  
This is a **daily execution log**, a **public accountability system**, and a **portfolio-in-progress**.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Over the course of four months, I am systematically building:

- Strong Python engineering fundamentals  
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills  
- Practical machine learning and deep learning expertise  
- Real-world project experience aligned with hiring expectations  

Everything learned, built, broken, and fixed will be tracked here.
